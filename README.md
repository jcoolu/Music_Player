## Information <a name = "information> </a>

This was a personal project that I created to get familiar with using JavaScript frameworks such as electron and jQuery. 
I created a program that is customizable and able to 
play any songs the user wants to include via adding the files to one of the project's folders. 
It's an interactive experience for when a user 
wants to play some music or watch a video in their own personal setting.
